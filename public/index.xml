      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>To me, music is an essential part of my everyday life. Music offers an opportunity to escape from the stress that accompanies my academic schedule and workload. Spotify has been my music source for years, and I knew the data collected from my Spotify would be an accurate representation of the songs and genre I most often listen to. During my data search, I found a data set from Kaggle that had collected the top fifty songs by country that were most played on Spotify in the year 2019.</description>

      <description>The dataset chosen was obtained from Kaggle. A career in the medical field has been a goal of mine since high school. My interest in medicine and studying different diseases influenced my decision in choosing this dataset. The dataset contains different characteristics of about 400 patients in order to decipher indications of chronic kidney disease. The dataset contains 400 observations and 26 variables. The dataset measures blood pressure, red blood cells, albumin, sugar, red blood cell count, pus cell, pus cell clumps, bacteria precense, blood glucose random, blood urea, white blood cell count, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, anemia, chronic kidney disease classification, and more.</description>
